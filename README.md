Since the PA28-181 isn't the Piper Archer CX, I've renamed the aircraft to `piper-archer-cx`.

# [piper-archer-cx](https://github.com/zlsa/piper-archer-cx)

You'll have to change the name of the directory from `pa28-181` to `piper-archer-cx` and edit `.git/config` to replace `pa28-181` with `piper-archer-cx`. (The git repository is the same, just renamed so you won't have to redownload the entire thing.)
