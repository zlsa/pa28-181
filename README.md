Since the PA28-181 isn't the Piper Archer, I've renamed the aircraft to `piper-archer`.

# [piper-archer](https://github.com/zlsa/piper-archer)

You'll have to change the name of the directory from `pa28-181` to `piper-archer` and edit `.git/config` to replace `pa28-181` with `piper-archer`. (The git repository is the same, just renamed, so you won't have to redownload the entire thing.)
